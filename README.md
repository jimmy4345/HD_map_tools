Developed based on the PCL (Point Cloud Library) and LAStools libraries, this C++ tool is designed for HD map processing. It also supports processing vector-based HD maps (lanelet2) and is developed using tinyXML. Currently, it has been successfully used and tested on HD maps produced by several surveying companies. The development of this tool is ongoing.
